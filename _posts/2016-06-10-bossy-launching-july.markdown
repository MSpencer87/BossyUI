On the Fourth of July Bossy UI will be launching. The team is pushing hard to have our first set of directives ready to release freeing the front end world from dependencies. The Bossy team rejects the idea that you have to included a million different code libraries to build and effective and beautiful application.

We want to put the control back in the hands of developers, putting them at the steering wheel of a powerful and simple set of reusable and light weight angular directives and giving them more time to do with they do best: build appications. Bossy comes packaged with a custom grid and UI pattern library to get any application moving from 0-60 with the speed of a red-lined Ferarri. Don't spend weeks of your life worry about laying out the perfect UI for your interactions. Let Bossy do the heavy lifting, just worry about creating the best application you can.
